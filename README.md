This analysis is based on data from Bridge Kenya programme which operates in 111 schools, in 7 provinces across 31 regions in Kenya. We have anonymized data for ~13,000 pupils from grades 1-5 from the end of an undisclosed school term in the past five years. (Note that each school year has three terms, and they consist of ~3-3.5 months each).
