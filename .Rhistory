# The way we interpret the KPI shifts with these two approaches due to their scope. When we calculate the network-level average, we're looking at the big picture, assessing how well the entire network (Bridge Kenya programme) is performing by considering all pupils across all schools. On the other hand, the school-level average narrows our focus to individual school performance, helping us pinpoint differences between schools. In this case it doesn't matter much because we get the same values for the KPIs through both approaches when rounded to two decimal places. However, it would matter when there is more heterogeneity across schools in terms of attendance rate and number of pupils. If there is more variation in attendance rate across schools and number of pupils, merely calculating percentage for each school and creating a simple average at the school-level would give the same weightage to each scool regardless of the number of pupils in that school, hence the value will deviate from the network-level average. The choice between these approaches hinges on the specific analysis or decision-making context. The network-level approach would one be more appropriate when we want to gauge the overall network performance, whereas the school-level approach is valuable for recognizing variations and addressing specific issues within each school. Ultimately, the choice depends on the specific objectives of the analysis or decision-making process.

# By running simple linear regression with Math, Kiswahili, Fluency, and Attendance score as the dependent variable and tutoring program as the independent variable we saw that tutoring program has a statistically significant positive effect on students' test scores in Math, Kiswahili, Fluency, and attendance on average. The results are highly statistically significant even at a significance level as low as 0.001.
# If teachers in schools that received tutoring indeed felt more motivated and were completing their lessons at a faster pace then tutoring program also has an effect on teachers completion rate. In that case teacher's lesson completion rate would be a confounding variable that also effects the outcome variable and is being effected by the treatment variable (tutoring program). If this is true, omitting teachers lesson completion rate from the regressions would make the results biased as the effects of teachers' higher lesson completion rate would also be wrongly attributed to the tutoring program.
#Let's first run a diagnostic regression regression of teachers lesson completion rate on tutoring program to see if there is any effect of tutoring program on lesson completion rate. Then, we will modify the above regressions by controlling for the effects of lesson completion rate by including this variable in our regression analysis as a covariate.
summary(lm(lesson_completion_rate ~ tutoring_program, data = pupil_teacher_school_df))
# In the above regression results, we see that tutoring program does not have a statistically significant effect on lesson completion rate. This suggests that it is not a significant confounder. However, it might be confounding in combination with the tutoring program variable so we should still use it as a control variable. Below, we control for lesson_completion_rate to see if the results of regression vary from the above ones.

summary(lm(Fluency ~ tutoring_program+lesson_completion_rate, data = pupil_teacher_school_df))
summary(lm(student_attendance_score ~ tutoring_program+lesson_completion_rate, data = pupil_teacher_school_df))
# By including lesson completion rate variable in our regression analysis as a covariate, we saw that the coefficients for tutoring program in all of the four regressions remained almost the same as before and were not effected much. Although we do see a statistically significant effect of lesson completion rate on students performance and attendance, this variable is independently assocaited with the outcome variables and does not mediate the effects of the tutoring program.
# The hypothesis that the effects that we saw are not (solely) due to the tutoring program, but also due to the higher lesson completion rate does not hold up in the data.
